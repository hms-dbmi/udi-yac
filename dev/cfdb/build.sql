-- Curate a cfdb (C2M2) dump into a star schema the YAC agent can serve.
-- Run by build_cfdb.py with the dump attached read-only as `src`; unqualified
-- tables are the output database. Plain SQL, so it ports to another engine.
--
-- C2M2 keys are (id_namespace, local_id), but local_id alone is unique in
-- every table here, so it is the key. Ontology codes are resolved to their
-- names, '' becomes NULL, and each child carries direct FKs to every parent
-- (the chat cross-filters along direct FKs only, no multi-hop).

-- ~11% of ENCODE files, so it is also more accurate than joining to Subjects.
